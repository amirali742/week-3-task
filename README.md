Following are the things which I have done in this weeks tesk:
1. Used the api key to get the real time weather details of countries from website "Open Weather", and the api is from "Current Weather Data".
2. Get city name from users. Users are also able to add more than 1 city name at a time. I have added 10 and got the results, which are in weather_data.csv, and weather_data.json.
3. Feteched city names, country names, temperature in Celcuis, weather, humidity, and wind speed in m/s of the countries entered by users.
4. Checked for errors like wrong api, wrong name, and netwrok error.
5. Used ("comma") to seperate the city names whe entering more than 1.
6. Displayed data in terminal also.
7.
